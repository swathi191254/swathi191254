### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Ever since I can remember, I have loved computers and everything related to it. When I was in school, the first computer-related lessons I learned were Microsoft Paint, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. That was when I developed a keen interest in computers.

After school, a lot of things changed. I was not able to pursue a computer-related degree in college for my bachelor's. However, my desire to pursue a computer-related course had not fizzled out; I had decided that I would pursue web development in the last year of my bachelor's.

I learned about Masai school through a non-profit organization named Swadha Foundation. Masai school has a very intense training program, however, I knew that my desire to pursue a career in handling computers could be achieved through Masai school.
Shortly after, I enrolled in Masai school to learn web development. Given my knack to learn things quickly, I was able to grasp the course well, and my "Don't Give Up" attitude led me to learn data structures, coding, and algorithms.

In the few months that I have spent in Masai school, I have been able to master MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Npm. Other than technical skills, I have also enhanced my communication skills, time management, and collaboration.

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading books, writing stories or poems, cooking, and practicing yoga.
